<p>My name is Antigone Buzhala. I am 23 years old and I come from Kosovo. A country with a sad history. Even though we were occupied for centuries, in 1998-1999 was the most difficult time for Albanians in Kosovo. Serbia started the war and killed many people and caused many massacres. Most of the people left the country and moved to Europe and America. That time I was one year old and my family immigrated to Switzerland where we lived for two years and then after the NATO helped Kosovo to get freedom we went back home. Two years ago I came to New York and currently I am a student at BMCC and my major is Multimedia Programming and Design.
